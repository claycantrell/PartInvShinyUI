- Add lab logo
- Change label "Focal group?" to "Focal group noninvariant?"
- "Input factor loadings \\( \\lambda \\) for the reference group" to "Reference group factor loadings"
- Heading for "unique factor variance-covariance," but no such headings for loadings and intercepts
- Font size?
- Not clear on the '10% population' function
    - It also generates a warning
- Move the latent means and variances up
- Maybe different panels for measurement, structural, and selection parameters?
- No error when the dimension of uniquness and loadings do not match
- Image aspect ratio?
- Clarification on mixing proportion (Reference-to-Focal or vice versa)
- Force to input focal group latent factor mean and variance

Enhancement:
- Computing reliability?
- Expected numbers (share sample paper); AI ratio
    - Separate page for multidimensional
