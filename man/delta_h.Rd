\title{Compute effect size for the impact of item deletion
Uses the formula below to compute the effect size for impact of item bias by
comparing Cohen's h values for a given selection accuracy index when an item
is deleted vs. included e.g. improvement in SE when item i is deleted:
$\Delta h_{SE^{(-i)}}=\text{sign}(h_{SE^{(R)}}-h_{SE^{(-i)}})
\left|\left|h_{SE^{(-i)}}\right|\left|h_{SE^{(-i)}}\right|\right|$}
\usage{
delta_h(h_R, h_i_del)
}
\arguments{
\item{h_R:}{h effect sizes for when the item is included}

\item{h_i_del:}{h effect sizes for when the item is deleted}
}
\value{
Cohen's h for the difference in the selection accuracy index when the
item is deleted
}
