\title{Delete item i and redistribute its weight within subscale
\code{redistribute_weights} replaces the item weight with 0 for the item to
be deleted, and redistributes this item's weight across the remaining items.}
\usage{
redistribute_weights(weights_item, n_dim = 1, n_i_per_dim = NULL, del_i)
}
\arguments{
\item{weights_item}{A vector of item weights.}

\item{n_dim}{Number of dimensions, 1 by default. If the user does not supply
a value, assumes that the scale is unidimensional.}

\item{n_i_per_dim}{A vector containing the number of items in each
dimension; NULL by default. If the user provides a value for n_dim
that is > 1 but leaves n_i_per_dim = NULL, assumes that the subscales
have an equal number of items.}

\item{del_i}{Index of the item to be deleted.}
}
\value{
\code{take_one_out} Weights vector with redistributed weights.
