\title{Compute SR, SE, SP weighted by group proportions
\code{get_perf} computes overall SR, SE, SP under partial invariance by
weighting the TP, TF, TN, FP values for the reference and focal groups with
the group proportions.}
\usage{
get_perf(pmixr, store_par_summary)
}
\arguments{
\item{pmixr}{Proportion of the reference group.}

\item{store_par_summary}{The summary table from \code{\link[=PartInv_Multi_we]{PartInv_Multi_we()}}
under partial invariance.}
}
\value{
A vector of length 3.
\itemize{
\item{SR}{Success ratio, computed as \eqn{TP/(TP + FP)}.}
\item{SE}{Sensitivity, computed as \eqn{TP/(TP + FN)}.}
\item{SP}{Specificity, computed as \eqn{TN/(TN + FP)}.}
}
